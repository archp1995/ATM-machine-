Key Features of the Project:
Multiple Accounts: The ATM class manages multiple Account objects, each representing a user.
User Authentication: The system checks the PIN and allows the user to proceed only if authenticated.
Transactions: Users can perform withdrawals, deposits, and view their transaction history.
Transaction History: All transactions (deposits and withdrawals) are stored and can be displayed to the user.
Menu-driven Interface: The ATM provides a simple text-based menu to interact with the system.
How to Compile and Run:
Using g++ Compiler (Linux/Windows using MinGW):

bash
Copy code
g++ atm_machine_project.cpp -o atm_project
./atm_project
Using an IDE:

Open the file in your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, Dev-C++).
Compile and run the project from within the IDE.
Future Enhancements:
File Handling: Add functionality to save user details and transaction history to a file so that it persists between sessions.
More Advanced Authentication: Add account number-based login in addition to PIN for increased security.
Improved UI: Develop a graphical interface (using libraries like Qt or SFML) for a more user-friendly experience.
